# DynamicMob

A highly configurable mob‚Äìspawn customizer for Paper/Folia 1.21.x.
Replace natural spawns with different mobs, equip them with randomized gear & vanilla-style enchants, create jockeys, power creepers, give skeletons block helmets, and even turn normal rabbits into The Killer Bunny ‚Äî all driven by config.yml.

    Works with NATURAL spawns, SPAWNER spawns, and (optionally) SPAWNER_EGG.

    Fully compatible with Folia.

    No plugin.yml required: /dm reload is registered at runtime (paper-plugin.yml only is fine).

‚ú® Features

    Replacement Spawns: Convert ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù mobs (e.g., ZOMBIE, SKELETON) into other types (e.g., PIGLIN, WITHER_SKELETON, BOGGED) with weighted chances.

    Scope Control: Choose where replacement applies: natural, spawner, and/or spawn egg.

    Spawn Chance Limits: Per‚Äìentity natural spawn probability (limit or disable certain mobs).

    Multiplier: Duplicate NATURAL monster spawns (excludes bosses).

    Equipment Tables: Slot-based item chances per mob (weapon/helmet/chest/legs/boots), with randomized durability.

    Vanilla-like Enchanting:

        Bows (Power, Punch, Flame, Infinity)

        Swords/Axes (Sharpness, Smite, Fire Aspect, Looting)

        Armor (Protection/Projectile/Blast, Thorns, Feather Falling on boots)

    Special Spawns:

        Charged Creeper chance

        Drowned with Channeling Trident chance

        Chicken/Spider Jockeys for the usual families

    Block Helmets:

        Global block helmets (e.g., Pumpkin)

        Skeleton-only block helmets (e.g., Obsidian, Bone Block)

        Applied only if the helmet slot is empty

    Piglin / Piglin Brute / Hoglin Zombification Immunity:

        Original spawn is canceled and replaced with a fresh immune entity (equivalent to /summon ... {IsImmuneToZombification:1})

    Killer Bunny (two ways):

        If a replacement result is RABBIT, optionally convert to THE_KILLER_BUNNY

        When a normal rabbit spawns, optionally convert to THE_KILLER_BUNNY based on chance & scope

    Pretty console banners on load/unload, and a tidy reload message.

‚úÖ Requirements

    Java 17+

    Paper or Folia 1.21.x

üì¶ Installation

    Build the plugin (or download the release JAR).

    Put the JAR in your server‚Äôs plugins/ directory.

    Use paper-plugin.yml (no plugin.yml needed).

    Start the server to generate config.yml.

    Tweak config.yml to your liking.

    Reload configs via /dm reload.

üîß Commands & Permissions

    /dm reload ‚Äì Reloads config.yml.
    Registered in code, so you don‚Äôt need to declare the command in paper-plugin.yml.

Permission: dynamicmob.reload (default: OP)

  PIGLIN:
    enabled: true
    weapon:
      GOLDEN_SWORD: 0.08
      GOLDEN_AXE: 0.05

    Notes

        In replacement-spawn, if the sum of weights is less than 1.0, the remaining probability keeps the original mob.

        If the sum is ‚â• 1.0, an original spawn of that mob is always replaced.

        Block helmets apply only when the mob‚Äôs helmet slot is empty. Skeleton-only block helmets are tried after general ones.

üß† How It Works

    Spawn Flow

        NATURAL spawn chance limit (per entity)

        Piglin/PiglinBrute/Hoglin: cancel & re-spawn as immune (no zombification, same as using summon NBT)

        Replacement: based on replacement-spawn + replacement.apply-to-*

            If the chosen result is RABBIT and killer_bunny_from_replacement is true, optionally convert to Killer Bunny

        Killer Bunny on Rabbit spawn: if enabled and scope matches

        Default equipment/specials/enchants/jockey logic

    Multiplier duplicates NATURAL monster spawns only (excludes Ender Dragon, Wither, Warden).

    Drowned Channeling is applied by a special token TRIDENT_CHANNELING in spawn-settings.weapon.

    Durability is randomized to feel more vanilla.

üïπÔ∏è Examples
Replace SKELETON with WITHER_SKELETON 50% of the time

replacement:
  apply-to-natural: true
  apply-to-spawner: false
  apply-to-spawn-egg: false

replacement-spawn:
  SKELETON:
    WITHER_SKELETON: 0.5

Give Skeletons a chance to wear Obsidian helmets

special:
  block_helmet:
    skeleton:
      OBSIDIAN: 0.02

Make normal Rabbits sometimes become The Killer Bunny on spawn

special:
  killer_bunny_on_rabbit_spawn:
    enabled: true
    chance: 0.03
    apply-to:
      natural: true
      spawner: false
      spawn-egg: false

üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

    /dm reload says ‚Äúunknown command‚Äù
    The command is registered in code at runtime. If it doesn‚Äôt appear:

        Ensure the plugin actually enabled (check console banner).

        Check for command name conflicts from other plugins.

        You only need paper-plugin.yml, not plugin.yml.

    Spawn eggs aren‚Äôt using custom settings
    Set mob-spawn.enable-spawn-egg: true.

    Some Nether mobs don‚Äôt appear naturally in the Overworld
    That‚Äôs vanilla behavior. Use replacement-spawn to convert Overworld mobs into Nether variants.

    Another plugin is also modifying spawns
    Conflicts can occur. Adjust priorities/order or disable overlapping features.
